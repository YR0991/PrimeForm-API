## 1. The Infradian Rhythm & Female Physiology
**Core Axiom:** Women are not "small men". While men operate on a 24-hour Circadian rhythm, women operate on a ~28-day Infradian rhythm, causing significant fluctuations in metabolism, thermoregulation, and neurochemistry.

### 1.1 The Phase Shift
* **Follicular Phase (Days 1-13):** Low hormone environment transitioning to Estrogen dominance.
    * *Metabolism:* High insulin sensitivity. Efficient glycogen storage.
    * *Immunity:* Resilient. Low systemic inflammation.
    * *Training:* High stress tolerance.
* **Ovulation (Days 14-16):** Peak Estrogen & Testosterone surge.
    * *Biomechanics:* Ligament laxity increases (ACL injury risk rises due to decreased collagen stiffness).
    * *Neurology:* Maximum CNS drive (Peak Strength potential).
* **Luteal Phase (Days 17-28):** Progesterone dominance.
    * *Metabolism:* Insulin resistance rises. Thermogenic drift (+0.3°C to +0.5°C).
    * *Catabolism:* Protein breakdown increases (up to 12%) for gluconeogenesis.

## 2. The Logic of Load: Why "Watts" are not equal
PrimeForm rejects linear load models (like TSS) because internal cost varies by phase.

### 2.1 The Luteal Tax (Cardiac Drift)
* **Physiology:** Progesterone raises core body temperature by ~0.5°C. To thermoregulate, blood is diverted to the skin for cooling.
* **Consequence:** Stroke volume decreases, forcing Heart Rate (HR) to rise to maintain Cardiac Output.
* **The PrimeForm Correction:** We apply a **Luteal Multiplier** (+5-12%) to the external load.
    * *Rationale:* 200 Watts in the Luteal phase costs more cardiac energy than 200 Watts in the Follicular phase.
    * *Drift Penalty:* If HR decouples from Power (>5% drift), the physiological cost is exponential, triggering a higher load penalty.

### 2.2 The "Elite Rebound" (Menstrual Physiology)
* **Standard Model:** Menstruation (Days 1-5) is inflammatory = REST.
* **Elite Reality:** For high-performers, the rapid drop in Progesterone (Day 1) removes the "Luteal Brake". Respiration improves, thermoregulation normalizes, and access to glucose restores immediately.
* **Implication:** If HRV rebounds >Baseline on Day 1-2, the athlete is primed for high intensity, despite bleeding. PrimeForm unlocks "PUSH" advice here.

## 3. Training Modalities: Neural vs. Metabolic
The algorithm selects the *type* of stress based on the dominant hormone.

### 3.1 Estrogen Dominance = Neural Adaptation (Follicular)
* **Mechanism:** 17β-estradiol is neuroprotective and acts similarly to testosterone regarding muscle repair. It increases myosin cross-bridge cycling speed.
* **Training Implication:** **PUSH - NEURAL**.
    * *Why:* The CNS can tolerate high loads (90%+ 1RM) and explosive movements (Plyometrics). Recovery from muscle damage (EIMD) is accelerated (approx 24h).

### 3.2 Progesterone Dominance = Metabolic Conditioning (Luteal)
* **Mechanism:** Progesterone raises Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) but creates a catabolic environment for muscle tissue.
* **Recovery Kinetics:** Recovery from HIIT/Anaerobic work is significantly slower (36-48h vs 24h) due to elevated cortisol and slower clearance of inflammation.
* **Training Implication:** **MAINTAIN - ENGINE**.
    * *Why:* Focus on Steady State (Zone 2) to utilize fat oxidation without triggering "Cortisol Stacking".

## 4. Metabolic Efficiency & Fueling Logic
This is critical for preventing "The Bonk" and RED-S.

### 4.1 The Glycogen Sparing Paradox (Late Luteal)
* **The Problem:** Progesterone inhibits the upregulation of GLUT-4 transporters. The body "hoards" glycogen for a potential pregnancy and refuses to use it during exercise.
* **The Risk:** If an athlete trains hard without exogenous carbs, the body enters a catabolic state (gluconeogenesis) rapidly, breaking down muscle for fuel.
* **PrimeForm Rule:** In Late Luteal, fueling is **MANDATORY** for sessions >45 mins. "Fasted Training" is strictly forbidden to prevent muscle wasting.

### 4.2 Nutrition Matrix by Phase

| Phase | Metabolic State | Nutritional Strategy | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Follicular** | Insulin Sensitive | **Carb Load** | Glycogen replenishment is 2x faster. Focus carbs pre/post workout. |
| **Ovulation** | High Oxidation | **Balanced** | Hydration is critical due to temp shift. |
| **Luteal** | Catabolic / Insulin Resistant | **Protein Pacing & Steady Carbs** | Increase protein (+20g) to prevent muscle breakdown. **MANDATORY INTRA-WORKOUT CARBS** for endurance. |
| **Menstrual** | Inflammatory | **Iron & Vit C** | Counteract blood loss (Ferritin drop). Vit C increases non-heme iron absorption by 4x. |

## 5. RED-S & Hormonal Health Monitoring
**Definition:** Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (RED-S) occurs when *Energy Availability (EA)* drops below 30 kcal/kg FFM/day.

### 5.1 The Anovulatory Cycle (The Flatline)
* **Healthy Marker:** A biphasic pattern in RHR (Low -> High) and HRV (High -> Lower).
* **Red Flag:** A "Flatline" profile (no mid-cycle shift) indicates Anovulation.
* **Cause:** Chronic stress/underfueling causes the Hypothalamus to downregulate the HPO-axis.
* **Action:** PrimeForm flags this as a health risk and blocks HIIT advice until recovery is shown.
