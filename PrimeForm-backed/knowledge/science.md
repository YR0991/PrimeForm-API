## 1. The Infradian Rhythm & Female Physiology
**Core Axiom:** Women are not "small men". While men operate on a 24-hour Circadian rhythm, women operate on a ~28-day Infradian rhythm, causing significant fluctuations in metabolism, thermoregulation, and neurochemistry.

### 1.1 The Phase Shift
* **Follicular Phase (Days 1-13):** Low hormone environment transitioning to Estrogen dominance.
    * *Metabolism:* High insulin sensitivity. Efficient glycogen storage.
    * *Immunity:* Resilient. Low systemic inflammation.
* **Ovulation (Days 14-16):** Peak Estrogen & Testosterone surge.
    * *Biomechanics:* Ligament laxity increases (ACL injury risk rises due to decreased collagen stiffness).
    * *Neurology:* Maximum CNS drive.
* **Luteal Phase (Days 17-28):** Progesterone dominance.
    * *Metabolism:* Insulin resistance rises. Thermogenic drift (+0.3°C to +0.5°C).
    * *Catabolism:* Protein breakdown increases (up to 12%) for gluconeogenesis.

## 2. Training Modalities: Neural vs. Metabolic
The algorithm selects the *type* of stress based on the dominant hormone.

### 2.1 Estrogen Dominance = Neural Adaptation (Follicular)
* **Mechanism:** 17β-estradiol is neuroprotective and acts similarly to testosterone regarding muscle repair. It increases myosin cross-bridge cycling speed.
* **Substrate:** Body relies on Glycolytic pathways (Carbohydrates).
* **Training Implication:** **PUSH - NEURAL**.
    * *Why:* The CNS can tolerate high loads (90%+ 1RM) and explosive movements (Plyometrics). Recovery from muscle damage is accelerated.
    * *Keywords:* Strength, Power, Speed, HIIT, Glycolytic Capacity.

### 2.2 Progesterone Dominance = Metabolic Conditioning (Luteal)
* **Mechanism:** Progesterone raises Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) by 2.5-10% but inhibits the uptake of glucose into cells (Glycogen Sparing). It promotes Fat Oxidation but limits high-intensity anaerobic capacity.
* **The Cortisol Trap:** High-intensity efforts (Zone 4/5) during this phase trigger an excessive cortisol response ("Cortisol Stacking"), leading to water retention and muscle catabolism.
* **Training Implication:** **MAINTAIN - ENGINE**.
    * *Why:* Lower intensities (Zone 2/3) utilize the increased fat oxidation capability without triggering the inflammatory cascade.
    * *Keywords:* Steady State, Hypertrophy (moderate load, slow eccentrics), Flow, Mobility.

## 3. The "Luteal Offset": Biometric Justification
**Problem:** Standard algorithms interpret the Luteal physiological shift as "Detraining" or "Sickness".
**PrimeForm Solution:** Recognizing the shift as a sign of *Health*.

### 3.1 Heart Rate Variability (HRV)
* **Fact:** Progesterone interacts with GABA receptors and exerts a thermogenic effect. This naturally withdraws Vagal Tone (Parasympathetic activity).
* **Data Trend:** A drop in rMSSD of 5-12% is expected.
* **Interpretation:** This is **not** a sign of accumulated fatigue or stress. It is the new "Homeostatic Baseline" for this phase.
* **User Advice:** "Your HRV is lower because your body is working harder to maintain a higher core temperature. This is a sign of healthy hormone production, not overtraining."

### 3.2 Resting Heart Rate (RHR)
* **Fact:** Cardiovascular Drift occurs due to thermoregulation. The heart beats faster to send blood to the skin for cooling.
* **Data Trend:** Increase of 2-5 bpm is standard.
* **Interpretation:** Do not interpret this as a loss of aerobic fitness.

## 4. RED-S & Hormonal Health Monitoring
**Definition:** Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (RED-S) occurs when *Energy Availability (EA)* drops below 30 kcal/kg FFM/day.

### 4.1 The Anovulatory Cycle (The Flatline)
* **Healthy Marker:** A biphasic pattern in RHR and Body Temperature (Low in Follicular -> Spike at Ovulation -> High in Luteal).
* **Red Flag:** A "Flatline" profile (no mid-cycle rise) indicates Anovulation.
* **Cause:** The Hypothalamus downregulates the HPO-axis (Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Ovarian) to conserve energy.
* **Implication:** Absence of progesterone means no bone density protection and no "Luteal Offset" needed.
* **Action:** Immediate cessation of HIIT and Fasted Training.

### 4.2 Iron Status & Menorrhagia (Heavy Bleeding)
* **Context:** Women with Copper IUDs or heavy flows lose significant Ferritin.
* **Mechanism:** Reduced Hemoglobin = Reduced Oxygen transport capacity ($VO_2max$ drop).
* **Implication:** Breathlessness during this phase is purely hematological, not a lack of lung capacity.

## 5. Nutritional Logic Matrix

| Phase | Metabolic State | Nutritional Strategy | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Follicular** | Insulin Sensitive | **Carb Load** | Muscle glycogen replenishment is 2x faster. Focus carbs pre/post workout. |
| **Ovulation** | High Oxidation | **Balanced** | Transition phase. Hydration is critical due to temp shift. |
| **Luteal** | Catabolic / Insulin Resistant | **Protein Pacing & Steady Carbs** | Increase protein (+20g) to prevent muscle breakdown. Avoid blood sugar spikes. |
| **Menstrual** | Inflammatory | **Iron & Vit C** | Counteract blood loss. Vit C increases non-heme iron absorption by 4x. |

### 5.1 De 'Menstrual Rebound'
Zodra progesteron daalt (start cyclus), ervaren fitte atleten vaak een energie-piek. Als HRV stabiel is (>98% baseline), wijst dit op lage systemische inflammatie en is trainen veilig.
